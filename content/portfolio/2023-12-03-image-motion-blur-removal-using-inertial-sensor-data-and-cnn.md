# Image Motion Blur Removal using Inertial Sensor Data and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project was done for a final project I did on _CIS 5810: Computer Vision & Computational Photography_, a course I took as an exchange student at the University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA.

The goal of the project was to create a tool to cancel out motion blur from images through the aid of inertial sensor movement data that was recorded when the photo was taken.
